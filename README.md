=========================================================================================================
            Hello everyone, I’ve created a tool to extract user data from Instagram.
=========================================================================================================
If anyone knows how to guide the tool towards future improvements, feel free to reach out to me!
=========================================================================================================

We will begin by explaining how to use the tool in a guided and simple way.
As soon as you start, you will find a menu that asks if you want to:

[1]Extract user information                                                   [2]Second passenger data intelligence
      |                                                                                      | 
      |                                                                                      |
      | --> Extract all the possible information that we will later use in the second option.|                                                      
                                                                                             |
                                                                                             |
Once the data from a profile is extracted, we will apply the data intelligence functions <-- |
which help identify the most recent people who have followed the user and common followers.
Subsequently, we can perform a local scan to find out which users the victim interacts with the most, quite accurately.

Recommendations
----Do not use your personal account, there is a risk of permanent account closure.
----Use accounts with which you have interacted with other users,
this makes Instagram less likely to suspect you during scans.
----Use saved sessions to avoid multiple logins,
this will help reduce the risk of being banned.
----Do not scan multiple users in a short period of time if Instagram is warning you,
take some time between scans (several days).
----Change accounts used for scanning in credentials.txt.
```
